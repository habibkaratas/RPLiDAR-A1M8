// RPLiDAR-A1M8

This is an Arduino program that uses a RPLidar sensor to measure distances, a LiquidCrystal display to show the angle and distance readings, and two servo motors to control the position of the RPLidar sensor. The program uses the RPLidar library to communicate with the sensor, the LiquidCrystal library to control the LCD, and the Servo library to control the servo motors. In the setup function, the program initializes the RPLidar sensor, the LCD, and the servo motors, and sets the initial positions of the servos to 0. In the loop function, the program continuously grabs scan data from the RPLidar sensor, processes the data, and displays the angle and distance readings on the LCD. It then maps the angle and distance values to servo positions and updates the servo positions accordingly. Additionally, it also checks the state of a button and turns on/off a pin depending on the state of the button.
